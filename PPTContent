Slide 2: Problem Statement
Current Challenges:

Excessive permissions in cloud environments lead to security risks.

Manual IAM role management is time-consuming and error-prone.

Lack of visibility into risky access patterns.

Rising cloud costs due to unused or over-provisioned permissions.

Impact:

Increased risk of data breaches.

Higher operational costs.

Compliance violations.

Slide 3: Our Solution
AI-Based Role & Access Governance Manager:

Automates IAM role and permission management.

Continuously analyzes permissions across cloud environments.

Detects excessive permissions and suggests least-privilege access.

Automatically revokes unused permissions.

Alerts admins about risky access patterns in real-time.

Key Features:

AI-driven insights.

Multi-cloud support (GCP, AWS, Azure).

Real-time monitoring and alerts.

Automated compliance reporting.

Slide 4: How It Works
Architecture Diagram:

Frontend: React.js Dashboard.

Backend: Python Flask API.

AI/ML: Anomaly detection and permission optimization.

GCP Services: IAM, Cloud Logging, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions.

Workflow:

Collect IAM roles and access logs.

Analyze permissions using AI/ML models.

Suggest least-privilege access.

Automate permission revocation.

Alert admins about risky patterns.

Slide 5: Cost Savings
Reduced Operational Costs:

Automates manual IAM management, saving admin time.

Eliminates over-provisioned permissions, reducing cloud costs.

Preventive Security:

Reduces risk of data breaches, saving potential fines and reputational damage.

Compliance Savings:

Automates compliance reporting, avoiding penalties.

Example:

A company with 1,000 users saves $50,000/year by optimizing permissions and reducing manual effort.

Slide 6: Ease of Use
Intuitive Dashboard:

React-based UI for easy navigation and insights.

Automation:

No manual intervention required for permission management.

Real-Time Alerts:

Admins receive instant notifications about risks.

Scalability:

Works across multiple cloud environments (GCP, AWS, Azure).

Quick Deployment:

Easy integration with existing cloud infrastructure.

Slide 7: Innovation
AI-Driven Insights:

Uses Isolation Forest and other ML models for anomaly detection.

Continuous Monitoring:

Real-time analysis of IAM roles and permissions.

Least-Privilege Access:

Ensures users have only the permissions they need.

Multi-Cloud Support:

Extends beyond GCP to AWS and Azure.

Slide 8: Technical Implementation
Frontend:

React.js for a responsive and interactive dashboard.

Backend:

Python Flask API for processing and GCP integration.

AI/ML:

Scikit-learn for anomaly detection.

TensorFlow for advanced pattern recognition.

GCP Services:

IAM, Cloud Logging, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions.
