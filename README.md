Implementing an AI-Based Role & Access Governance Manager on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) involves several components, including frontend, backend, AI/ML models, and GCP services. Below is a detailed implementation plan for a production-ready application with React as the frontend and Python as the backend.

Key Features
    1. Continuous IAM Role & Permission Analysis:
        a. Analyze IAM roles and permissions across GCP projects.
        b. Detect excessive permissions and unused roles.
    2. Least-Privilege Access Model:
        a. Suggest minimal required permissions for users and services.
    3. Automated Permission Revocation:
        a. Automatically revoke unused or excessive permissions.
    4. Risky Access Pattern Detection:
        a. Use AI/ML to detect and alert admins about risky access patterns.
    5. Dashboard & Reporting:
        a. Provide a React-based dashboard for admins to view insights and take action.
    6. Audit Logging:
        a. Log all changes and actions for compliance and auditing.

Architecture
    1. Frontend: React.js
        a. Dashboard for admins to view insights, manage permissions, and receive alerts.
    2. Backend: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)
        a. REST API to handle requests, interact with GCP services, and process AI/ML models.
    3. AI/ML Layer:
        a. Train and deploy models for detecting excessive permissions and risky access patterns.
    4. GCP Services:
        a. IAM & Policy Analyzer: Analyze IAM roles and permissions.

            i.   Role & Permission Viewer.
            ii.  Risk Alerts Panel.
            iii. Audit Logs Viewer.
            iv.  Reports & Analytics.

    2. Backend (Python)
        a. Framework: Flask/Django/FastAPI.

        b. Endpoints:
            i.   /analyze-roles: Analyze IAM roles and permissions.
            ii.  /suggest-least-privilege: Suggest least-privilege access.
            iii. /revoke-permissions: Automatically revoke unused permissions.
            iv.  /detect-risky-access: Detect and alert risky access patterns.
            v.   /audit-logs: Fetch audit logs for compliance.

        c. GCP Integration:
            a. Use google-cloud-iam and google-cloud-logging libraries to interact with GCP services.
            b. Use google-cloud-bigquery for data analysis.
            c. Use google-cloud-pubsub for event-driven alerts.

    3. AI/ML Layer
        a. Data Collection:
            i. Collect IAM role and permission data using GCP IAM API.
            ii. Collect access logs using Cloud Logging.
        b. Model Training:
            i. Train a model to detect excessive permissions using historical data.
            ii. Train a model to detect risky access patterns using anomaly detection techniques.
        c. Model Deployment:
            i. Deploy models on GCP AI Platform.
            ii. Use Cloud Functions to trigger model predictions.

    4. GCP Services
        a. IAM & Policy Analyzer:
            i. Continuously analyze IAM roles and permissions.
        b. Cloud Logging:
            i. Monitor access patterns and log events.
        c. Cloud Functions: 
            i. Automate permission revocation and send alerts via Pub/Sub.
        d. BigQuery:
            i. Store and analyze large datasets for AI/ML.
        e. Pub/Sub:
            i. Handle event-driven notifications (e.g., alerts).
        f. Cloud Storage:
            i. Store audit logs and reports.

Creating Roles
    Option 1: Using Google Cloud Console
        Go to the Google Cloud Console.
        Navigate to IAM & Admin > Roles.
        Click Create Role.
        Enter a Role Name (e.g., custom.role1).
        Add permissions to the role (e.g., storage.buckets.get, storage.buckets.list).
        Click Create.

    Option 2: Using gcloud CLI
        Install the Google Cloud SDK if you havenâ€™t already.
        Authenticate with your Google account:
            gcloud auth login
        Create a custom role:
            gcloud iam roles create custom_role1 --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
                --title="Custom Role 1" \
                --description="A custom role with limited permissions" \
                --permissions=storage.buckets.get,storage.buckets.list

            gcloud iam roles create custom_role2 --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
                --title="Custom Role 2" \
                --description="Another custom role" \
                --permissions=compute.instances.get,compute.instances.list
